Bash script to use to create data for the shiny App

edit the path and other variables in the tracknas script
make the scrip executable and place it in soem folder where it can execute
run the script each time you want to add data for monitoring (tip: put the script in a cron job)
run the Shiny app to plot and show tables from the saved data

Have fun!
